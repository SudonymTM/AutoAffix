# AutoAffix
## This is the repo for the AutoAffix Tool.
Here you can get all newest updates/bugfixes and an introduction!



----
## 1. Installation

Installation is easy.
Setup a new Folder in which you want to be using this Tool.
Extract the newest release in that Folder.

**NOTE**: For this script to work, you need to have your Keys generated! - The ArchiveFix Tool is located in `lib`.
Please refer to the [Rage:MP Tutorial by Ari](https://rage.mp/forums/topic/1194-how-to-affix-vehicle-addon-mods/) for instructions on how to accomplish that.



----
## 2. Usage
Nothing has to be configured, except for generating the Keys for ArchiveFix.
The Tool scans for File Changes in `workdir`, so you just have to extract the dlc.rpf into that Folder.

After the Tool showed you that it patched everything it detected, you're clear to repack the patched Files
into the new dlc.rpf and afterwards patch the new dlc.rpf aswell.

As stated, please remember to patch the repacked dlc.rpf!

Also, don't forget to delete/move all Files from `workdir` after each Patch!


----
## 3.  Other
First off, thanks for using AutoAffix.
If you find any Bugs or you have any Ideas, just contribute, open up an Issue or write me a Message.
Other than that, I'll try to find a way to automate the .rpf extraction and repacking aswell, until then, watchout for updates.

**Have fun using AutoAffix** :)
